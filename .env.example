# Google Sheets API Configuration
# You have two options to authenticate:

# Option 1: Use a JSON key file (recommended for local development)
# - Download the JSON key file from Google Cloud Console
# - Save it as: gen-lang-client-0312769039-f45a7c9ff94b.json
# - It's already in .gitignore, so it won't be committed

# Option 2: Use environment variables (recommended for production)
